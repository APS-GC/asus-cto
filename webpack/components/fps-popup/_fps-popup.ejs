        <p>
          FPS stands for "Frames Per Second". It measures how many frames (images) your computer can
          render and display every second while playing a game. Higher FPS means smoother gameplay, as
          your screen refreshes images more frequently.
        </p>

          Note that all FPS performance data presented are theoretical and may vary in real-world
          usage. The FPS data is based on third-party testing conducted by UL and is provided for
          reference purposes only. Actual performance may differ.

          <li>
            <strong>30 FPS:</strong> Playable but may feel choppy, especially in
            fast-paced games.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>60 FPS:</strong> Ideal for most games, providing smooth and
            responsive gameplay.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>120 FPS or higher:</strong> Excellent for competitive gaming,
            offering a fluid experience on high-refresh-rate monitors.

          <strong>PS:</strong> If you have a monitor with higher resolution (e.g., 1440p), you might
          need a stronger GPU to reach enough FPS for good gaming experience.

        <h3 class="dialog-section-title">How to increase my FPS?</h3>
        <p>
          The most effective way to increase your FPS is by upgrading your GPU, CPU, and RAM, as these
          are the key hardware components that affect gaming performance. Additionally, adjusting the
          in-game graphics settings—such as lowering resolution, shadows, and texture quality—can also
          help improve FPS to a certain extent, depending on your computer’s capabilities.
